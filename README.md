# Juilee-Cybersecurity-Portfolio

## Professional Summary üíº
I am Juilee Gund, a Cybersecurity Professional with a master's degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Birmingham. I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and quality assurance within blockchain technology. In my role as a QA Specialist at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I led a diverse team to execute test plans for large-scale blockchain solutions, improving test efficiency and ensuring compliance with global security standards.

During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience in conducting vulnerability assessments, reverse engineering, and securing both hardware and software systems. I also had the opportunity to work on projects like IoT penetration testing, automated fuzz testing, and developing a secure public broadcast platform. These experiences helped me deepen my understanding of cybersecurity principles and sharpen my technical skills using tools like BurpSuite, Wireshark, and Aircrack-ng.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to further enhance my capabilities and stay up to date with the latest security trends. I am also certified in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C, which allow me to approach cybersecurity challenges with a strong coding foundation.

My goal is to become a Security Analyst, a role that aligns with my strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and passion for addressing emerging cybersecurity threats. As of 2024, I am preparing for key certifications such as **CompTIA Security+** and **Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA)** to enhance my qualifications further.
