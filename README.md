# Juilee-Cybersecurity-Portfolio

## Professional Summary
I am Juilee Gund, a Cybersecurity Professional with a master's degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Birmingham. I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and quality assurance within blockchain technology. In my role as a QA Specialist at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I led a diverse team to execute test plans for large-scale blockchain solutions, improving test efficiency and ensuring compliance with global security standards.

During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience in conducting vulnerability assessments, reverse engineering, and securing both hardware and software systems.

These experiences helped me deepen my understanding of cybersecurity principles and sharpen my technical skills using tools like BurpSuite, Wireshark, and Aircrack-ng.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to further enhance my capabilities and stay up to date with the latest security trends. I am also certified in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C, which allow me to approach cybersecurity challenges with a strong coding foundation.

My goal is to become a Security Analyst, a role that aligns with my strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and passion for addressing emerging cybersecurity threats. As of 2024, I am preparing for key certifications such as **CompTIA Security+** and **Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA)** to enhance my qualifications further.
